# MoveSense X95 ROS 2 Driver (movesense_x95_ros2)

> **Status: 0.1.0 — early release.** Interfaces (topics / parameters) may
> still change before 1.0.

ROS 2 (Humble) driver for the MoveSense X95-series stereo depth camera. It
connects to the camera over Ethernet (via the MoveSense X95 SDK), receives
frames and IMU on dedicated threads, and publishes:

- left / right stereo images
- depth image + depth camera_info
- color image + color camera_info (active A / AP cameras only)
- IMU (~200 Hz)
- YOLO detections (`vision_msgs/msg/Detection2DArray`)

The node auto-detects the camera form factor (A / AP / P) and adapts the
output (see [Camera types](#camera-types)).

This package is the ROS 2 port of `movesense_x95_ros` (ROS 1 / Noetic); the
camera-side logic, parameters and topic names are identical. Note that ROS 2
adds QoS semantics that ROS 1 has no equivalent for — see
[Published topics](#published-topics) before writing subscribers.

## Requirements

| Item    | Requirement               |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| OS      | Ubuntu 22.04 (x86-64)     |
| ROS     | Humble                    |
| Build   | colcon (`ament_cmake`)  |
| Network | same subnet as the camera |

## Dependencies

```bash
# ROS packages
sudo apt install ros-humble-rclcpp ros-humble-sensor-msgs \
                 ros-humble-std-msgs ros-humble-vision-msgs ros-humble-tf2-ros libopencv-dev
```

### MoveSense X95 SDK

This driver is a thin ROS wrapper around the **MoveSense X95 SDK**, which does
all the camera-side work: device discovery, the four network channels, frame
and IMU reception, parameter configuration and calibration read-back. The SDK
is a **separate repository, not bundled here** - install it first:

- Source: https://github.com/manplus-ai/MoveSense_X95_SDK/

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manplus-ai/MoveSense_X95_SDK.git
cd MoveSense_X95_SDK
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
sudo make install          # installs to /usr/local by default
```

The package then locates it through `find_package(MoveSense_X95_SDK REQUIRED)`
and links the imported target `MoveSense::X95_SDK`; nothing else is needed as
long as the SDK is installed into a prefix CMake searches (`/usr/local` by
default). Two public headers are used: `<movesense/Simou3Camera.h>` (camera
API) and `<movesense/Simou3CalibLayout.h>` (calibration blob field offsets,
used here to parse intrinsics / baseline / color and IMU extrinsics).

The SDK library itself has no third-party dependencies.

> **Version compatibility — read this before mixing versions.**
> This driver is built and tested against **MoveSense X95 SDK 0.2.1**, and
> requires **0.2.1 or newer**: the calibration parsing includes
> `<movesense/Simou3CalibLayout.h>`, which was introduced in 0.2.1. Older
> SDKs will not compile against this package (0.2.0 and earlier also differ
> elsewhere - the `movesense` namespace only appeared in 0.2.0).
>
> Until the SDK reaches **1.0.0 its public API is still changing
> substantially between releases**, so always pair this driver with the SDK
> version it was released against instead of mixing versions. Check what is
> installed with `simou3_get_version_string()` from
> `<movesense/Simou3Camera.h>`, or by looking at
> `/usr/local/lib/libMoveSense_X95_SDK.so.*`.

OpenCV is used for NV21→BGR color conversion and IMU calibration XML I/O.

All image and IMU topics are published with `SensorDataQoS` (best effort).
Subscribers must use a compatible QoS profile (e.g. `rclcpp::SensorDataQoS()`)
or they will not receive any data. `camera_info` and detection topics use the
default reliable QoS.

Topics are only advertised when their stream is enabled: `left` / `right`
require `enable_stereo:=true` (off by default), `color*` requires
`enable_color` on an A/AP camera, and `detections` requires
`enable_detection`. A topic that is not advertised never appears in
`ros2 topic list`.

## Camera types

The node queries `getCameraType()` and adapts automatically:

| Type   | Stereo (left/right)   | Color topic         | Detection source |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| A / AP | `mono8` (grayscale) | RGB lens →`bgr8` | RGB              |
| P      | `bgr8` (NV21→BGR)  | not published       | right eye        |

Depth is always rendered from the right camera viewpoint. On P cameras it
stays there regardless of `registration`, since there is no color stream to
register to.

The shipped launch defaults (`enable_color=true`, `registration=1`,
`doe_power=255`) target **active A / AP** cameras. On a **passive P**
camera set `enable_color:=false` and `enable_stereo:=true` — P has no RGB
lens, and the rectified stereo pair (published as `bgr8`) is its image
source. Depth→color registration also has no effect without an RGB lens:
on P the depth stays in the stereo frame and its camera_info always uses
stereo intrinsics, regardless of the `registration` value. P has no DOE
projector either, so `doe_power` is not applicable. The node ignores all
three on P (with a warning) instead of sending them to the camera.

## Frames

The node broadcasts the static TF tree below once at startup (set
`publish_tf:=false` to suppress it, e.g. when your own URDF already provides
these transforms):

```
movesense_link
└── movesense_infra1_frame
      └── movesense_infra1_optical_frame        <- left eye, reference frame of all calibration
            ├── movesense_infra2_optical_frame  <- right eye  (+baseline on x)
            ├── movesense_color_optical_frame   <- color lens
            │     └── movesense_imu_frame       <- IMU, on an A camera
            └── movesense_imu_frame             <- IMU, on an AP / P camera
```

**The IMU frame hangs off a different parent depending on the camera type**,
because the two models are calibrated against different cameras:

| Type | IMU parent | Calibration source |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| **A** | `movesense_color_optical_frame` | IMU segment of the **color** calibration blob |
| **AP** / **P** | `movesense_infra1_optical_frame` | IMU segment of the **stereo** calibration blob |

The node picks the parent from the type reported by the camera; it does not
guess from whichever segment happens to be filled in. On an A camera the color
frame must be part of the tree (color stream on, or depth registered),
otherwise the IMU transform is skipped with a warning.

- `infra1` = **left** eye, `infra2` = **right** eye. Every extrinsic stored in
  the camera is expressed relative to the left eye, so `infra1_optical_frame`
  is the parent of the other sensor frames.
- `movesense_link` → `movesense_infra1_frame` is identity; the
  `*_frame` → `*_optical_frame` step carries the standard REP-103 body-to-optical
  rotation (x right, y down, z forward), so the calibration numbers are used
  as-is without any hand conversion.
- All camera frames are **rectified** frames: the published images are already
  rectified and their distortion is zero, so no undistortion or rectification
  rotation is needed downstream.
- Right eye and color are pure translations from the left eye (rectified stereo
  is row-aligned, and the color rectification rotation is already baked into the
  camera's own calibration), so their rotations are identity.
- The color and IMU transforms are only broadcast when the calibration actually
  contains those extrinsics (and, for color, when the color frame is in use);
  otherwise the node logs a warning and skips that transform. The startup log
  line `[TfPublisher] IMU frame attached to <frame>` tells you which parent was
  used.

Depth does **not** get a frame of its own — it follows `registration`, exactly
like its `camera_info`. Depth is rendered from the **right** camera viewpoint
(most stereo cameras use the left eye as reference, this one does not): with
`registration=0` the depth image lives in `movesense_infra2_optical_frame`;
with `registration=1` it is reprojected into `movesense_color_optical_frame`.

Frame names are configurable (`base_frame_id`, `cam0_frame_id`,
`cam1_frame_id`, `color_frame_id`, `imu_frame_id`, `det_frame_id`); the
intermediate `movesense_infra1_frame` follows `cam1_frame_id`.

## Resolution & downsampling

Each of stereo / depth / color is either **1280×960** (full) or **640×480**
(downsampled); other sizes are rejected.

**Color is independent.** It has its own rectification group on the camera, so
`color_width` / `color_height` can be set freely and never constrains stereo or
depth. A full-resolution color stream alongside a downsampled depth stream
(1280×960 color + 640×480 depth) is a supported combination.

`downsample_mode` selects **where** the stereo/depth pipeline downsamples, and
affects only those two streams:

- **pre** (`0`) — downsample first, then match. Matching runs on the small
  image: faster, allows a higher frame rate, lower range accuracy.
- **post** (`1`) — match first, then downsample the result. More accurate, but
  the frame-rate ceiling is lower and DPU load is higher.

Valid combinations (**stereo ≥ depth**):

| stereo | depth | `downsample_mode` |
| ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| 640×480 | 640×480 | `0` or `1`, both valid |
| 1280×960 | 640×480 | `1` only — pre would shrink the stereo pair too |
| 640×480 | 1280×960 | unsupported, the node exits with an error |
| 1280×960 | 1280×960 | nothing is downsampled, the mode is ignored |

The default is `0` (pre), matching the default 640×480 stereo and depth
streams. `-1` (auto) is also accepted: post when stereo is larger than depth,
pre otherwise.

## IMU calibration export (optional)

Set `imu_calib_dir` to a writable directory; on connect the node writes four
XMLs per calibrated segment: `r_IMU.xml` (R 3×3), `t_IMU.xml` (t, mm),
`ts_IMU.xml` (timeshift, ms), `noise_IMU.xml` (gyro/accel noise density +
random walk).

The camera stores **two** IMU extrinsic segments, and they are written to
separate subdirectories with identical file names (same layout as the vendor
calibration tool):

| Subdirectory | Segment | Reference camera |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| `<imu_calib_dir>/xml`     | IMU segment of the stereo blob | **left** rectified camera |
| `<imu_calib_dir>/xml_rgb` | IMU segment of the color blob  | **color** rectified camera |

Only calibrated segments are written: an all-zero or non-finite segment means
"not calibrated" and that subdirectory is skipped. Typically an A camera has
only `xml_rgb` and an AP / P camera only `xml`. Reading the color segment
requires the color calibration to be read, which the node does whenever
`imu_calib_dir` is set (on non-passive cameras), even if the color stream is off.

Notes on the format:

- The files are OpenCV `cv::FileStorage` XML; the values are exported
  verbatim from the calibration stored on the camera (same content as the
  vendor calibration tool exports).
- Field names follow [kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr)
  conventions (`timeshift_cam_imu`, `*_noise_density`, `*_random_walk`),
  but the units are **mm** for `t_IMU` and **ms** for `ts_IMU` — convert to
  m / s before feeding a kalibr-style camchain yaml (e.g. for OpenVINS /
  ORB-SLAM3 VIO configs).
- Reference frame: **which camera the extrinsic is relative to is decided by
  the subdirectory**, so never mix the two. `xml` is relative to the left
  rectified camera, `xml_rgb` to the color rectified camera; both are
  expressed in that camera's optical frame (x right, y down, z forward).
  `r_IMU` / `t_IMU` are the rotation and translation parts of kalibr's
  `T_cam_imu`: `R` maps vectors from the IMU frame into that camera's frame,
  `t` is the IMU origin expressed in that camera's frame (mm). `ts_IMU`
  follows `t_imu = t_cam + ts` (ms). Note that depth is right-eye based while
  neither IMU segment is, so a VIO config that mixes them needs the baseline
  and the color extrinsic to bridge the frames.
- Published IMU timestamps do **not** have this timeshift applied. Apply it
  yourself if your pipeline needs it.
